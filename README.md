# Team Armadillo Enterprise Ready AI
**IBM AI Experiential Learning Lab 2025**

This repository contains the final submission materials for the *Enterprise-Ready AI* project built entirely within IBM watsonx.ai. The solution demonstrates programmatic access to Granite foundation models, risk evaluation logic, and compliance logging for governance.

Use this repo in two complementary ways:
- **Guided walkthrough for non-technical reviewers** who want to inspect the artifacts without executing code.
- **Hands-on setup for technical contributors** who plan to run or extend the agent.

> Need an exact checklist for running the project? See the [Setup & Operations Runbook](docs/SETUP.md).

## Guided walkthrough (non-technical)
1. Start with the [Project Scope](#project-scope) to understand the business challenge and expected outcomes.
2. Review the `/data` folder for:
   - `sample_bank_policy.csv` – sample policy input.
   - `bank_policy_summary.json` – example narrative generated by the agent.
3. Browse `notebooks/` to see the experimentation history. Each notebook documents the objective, prompt evolution, and resulting artifacts, so you can follow the story without running code.
4. Capture feedback using the [Validation & Next Steps](#validation--next-steps) checklist and hand it to the engineering team.

## Hands-on setup (technical)
1. **Create a virtual environment** (Python 3.11+):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Provide watsonx credentials**:
   ```bash
   export IBM_API_KEY="<your-key>"
   export WATSONX_URL="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com"  # override if needed
   export PROJECT_ID="<project-or-empty>"
   export SPACE_ID="<space-or-empty>"
   ```
   - Only one of `PROJECT_ID` or `SPACE_ID` is required.
   - CLI flags `--project-id` and `--space-id` override environment variables per run.
4. **Run the agent** from the repo root:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src python -m scripts.run_agent "How should I evaluate a mortgage refinance in Texas?" \
     --vector-index-id 40824957-150a-4607-a08c-7f8885b0befa
   ```
   - Add `--print-full-response` for verbose JSON output.
   - Outputs and governance logs are written to `/data` with timestamps.
5. **Inspect the artifacts** listed below to validate the run and prepare demos.

## Repository layout
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `src/agent_lab/` | Reusable Python package extracted from the original watsonx notebook (agent graph, auth, config, tooling). |
| `scripts/` | Operational helpers including `run_agent.py` (CLI), compliance logging utilities, and connectivity helpers. |
| `data/` | Sample datasets plus generated risk summaries/governance logs. Safe to clean between demos. |
| `notebooks/` | Archived experimentation notebooks for storytelling and reproducibility. |
| `docs/SETUP.md` | Detailed runbook for recreating the environment end-to-end. |

## Validation & Next Steps
- **Non-technical reviewers**:
  - Does the generated risk narrative match compliance expectations?
  - Are the governance logs sufficient for audit trails?
  - Which additional policy types should be evaluated next?
- **Technical contributors**:
  - Adjust prompt templates or agent graph nodes in `src/agent_lab`.
  - Integrate outputs with downstream systems or dashboards.
  - Containerize the CLI or schedule it via orchestration tooling.

Log follow-up tasks as GitHub issues so changes remain traceable.

## Project Scope
- Industry: **Banking**
